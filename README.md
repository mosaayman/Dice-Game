# Dice Game

This is a simple two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a die, accumulating points until one player reaches a score of 100.

## How to Play

Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die.
If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and the other player starts their turn.
If you roll any other number, it's added to your current score.
Choose to either "Hold" your score and end your turn or "Roll Dice" again to try for a higher score.
The first player to reach 100 points wins!
